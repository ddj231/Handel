# New language features

## Proposing language features

To propose a new language feature, open an issue describing the feature to be added. Be as detailed as possible, perhaps including examples of the syntax, etc.

## Adding language features

Before beginning work on a new language feature. Propose the issue (as above) -- and state that you would like to implement or partially implement the feature.

Wait for feedback on the language feature, and whether it would make sense given the scope of Handel, before implementing. Then implement, and make a pull request.

This is to limit rejected pull requests, so your time is not wasted.
