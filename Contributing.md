# Adding language features

Before beginning work on a new language feature. Propose the issue (as above) -- and state that you would like to implement or partially implement the feature.

Wait for feedback on the language feature, and whether it would make sense given the scope of Handel, before implementing. Then implement, and make a pull request.

This is to limit rejected pull requests, so we do not waste your time.
